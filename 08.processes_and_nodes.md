# Processes and Nodes

- Creating and connecting nodes
- Sending messages between nodes
- Code running on all CPUs

```elixir
iex> c "messages.ex"
iex> {:ok, pid} = Messages.start_link
{:ok, #PID<0.61.0>}
iex> Process.register(pid, :messages)
true
iex> send :messages, {"hello", self()}
What do you mean? I'm only listening to pings and pongs!
{"hello", #PID<0.53.0>}
iex> send :messages, {"what", self()}
What do you mean? I'm only listening to pings and pongs!
{"what", #PID<0.53.0>}
iex> send :messages, {"ping", self()}
So ping to you too!
{"ping", #PID<0.53.0>}
iex> send :messages, {"pong", self()}
So pong to you too!
{"pong", #PID<0.53.0>}
iex> send :messages, {"pong", self()}
So pong to you too!
{"pong", #PID<0.53.0>}
iex> send :messages, {"ping", self()}
So ping to you too!
{"ping", #PID<0.53.0>}
iex> send :messages, {"bye", self()}
What do you mean? I'm only listening to pings and pongs!
{"bye", #PID<0.53.0>}
iex> flush
