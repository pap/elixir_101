# Pattern Matching

Some people say the concept of pattern matching is difficult to grasp by someone coming from OO world...
I think the concept of assigning is harder to grasp when the first language you learn is OO!

```ruby
2.1.5 :001 > a = 1
 => 1
2.1.5 :002 > b = 1
 => 1
2.1.5 :003 > c = 2
 => 2
2.1.5 :004 > a = c
 => 2
```

```elixir
iex> a = 1
1
iex> b = 1
1
iex> c = 2
2
iex> ^a = b
1
iex> ^a = c
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: 2
iex> a = c
2
iex> a
2
```

```elixir
iex> list = [1,2,3,4,5]
[1,2,3,4,5]
iex> [ h | t ] = list
[1,2,3,4,5]
iex> [ h | _ ] = list
[1,2,3,4,5]
iex> h
1
iex> [ _ | t ] = list
[1,2,3,4,5]
iex> t
[2,3,4,5]
iex> tuple = { :ok, { :name, "John" } }
:ok, {:name, "John"}}
iex> {_, {_, name}} = tuple
{:ok, {:name, "John"}}
iex> name
"John"
```

Now a code example ... lets pattern match on a MP3 file!
