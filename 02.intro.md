# Intro

## What is Elixir?

Elixir is a dynamic functional language running on the Erlang VM. It was inspired by some programming languages as Ruby, Clojure and Erlang.
It allows us to build scalable and maintainable applications.

## Erlang? Why do I need to care about it?

Erlang was created at Ericsson by by Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding and Mike Williams. The first version was released in 1986.
Elixir allows us to easily interact with existing Erlang libraries/applications.
It is really simple to access Erlang code from Elixir!

## Well why don't just write ruby-like code in Elixir? The syntax is so close!

Elixir may have a familiar syntax for the Ruby developer but what really matters is the semantics!
