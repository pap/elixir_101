# Intro

## What is Elixir?

* Dynamic functional language running on the Erlang VM
* Inspired by some programming languages as Ruby, Clojure and Erlang
* Allows us to build scalable and maintainable applications
* Processes (lots of them)
* Actor model

## Erlang? What is it and do I need to care about it?

* Erlang was created at Ericsson by by Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding and Mike Williams. The first version was released in 1986
* Elixir allows us to easily interact with existing Erlang libraries/applications
* No need to know Erlang to write Elixir but no harm in knowing about it either

## Isn't Elixir just Erlang with a Ruby-like syntax?

Elixir may have a familiar syntax for the Ruby developer but what really matters is the semantics! There is a huge difference between Ruby and Elixir!

## Let it crash ! Fail fast ! Happy path programming

* When we are dealing with distributed systems things will fail (all the time)
* Sometimes (most actually) the best way to recover from a failure is to start all over again
* Follow the happy path and don't worry about everything that may go wrong
